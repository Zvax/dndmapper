# Creating, managing and maintaining interactive maps

Alex is creating an encounter for his team. He draws an irregular shape of wooden walls encircling a camp with tents.

He creates a timeline from which an encounter happening in this location will draw events,
for instance if a nightly attack happen, from a specific point 1d4 ennemies wake up each round.

He adds tents on the map and links them to the scripted timeline, they're the spawning point of the ennemies.
Each ennemy location is established beforehand, and no more than 2 are present by tent.

He creates a building with a locked door, associates the DC. If a character interacts with the door during gameplay,
she will be presented with various actions, such as unlocking but not opening (based on the existence of the DC).
Of course, as long as the character can't interact with the door, she doesn't know if the door is locked or not.
