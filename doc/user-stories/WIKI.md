Bob really likes fantastic universes. If he could, he'd live in these.
One morning, Bob opens DNDMapper's universe wiki to throw some ideas.

First, he's not quite sure what he's about to write, so he just throws a few ideas in the wisiwyg editor.
When saving, these ideas are grouped in a work space, in which he sees any such spurious files.
Bob realizes he hasn't yet decided in which universe these ideas belonged, so he creates a new universe entry in the wiki.
He moves the spurious idea file from the general workspace into the new universe's specific workspace.
