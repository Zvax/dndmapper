we want somethign like



$entity->executeAction(FireArrow::class)




the goal is to allow entities to interact between one anoter on a map
at any moment, it's easy to know, all the actions a entity can do
all the targets any action can target

the sum of all actions a character can do are:
- base entity possible actions
- minus circumstantial modifiers
- minus unreachable targets
